## Contribution

For contributing to Elemental, please create a fork of the repository and send a Pull Request (PR). A number of GitHub Actions will be triggered on the PR and they need to pass.

Before opening a Pull Request, use `golangci-lint fmt` to format the code and `golangci-lint run` to execute linting steps that are configured in `/.golangci.yml` in the base directory of the repository.

Please make sure to follow these guidelines with regards to logging and error-handling:
* Avoid logging the very same error in multiple places on error-return
* Error logging must include at least one piece of detail, never a log without details
* Prefer logging in multiple lines rather than wrapping it into a single line

PRs will be reviewed by the maintainers and require two reviews without outstanding change-request to pass and become mergeable.
